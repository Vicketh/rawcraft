## Rawcraft Website - Logo Enhancement

### ðŸ“‹ Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented a professional shining animation effect on the Rawcraft camera logo and removed the redundant text below it, creating a cleaner and more impactful visual presentation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Changes Made

### 1. Removed "RAWCRAFT" Text Below Logo

**Before**: Logo had "RAWCRAFT" text, divider line, and tagline below it
```javascript
// Old structure - cluttered with multiple text elements
React.createElement("div", { className: "logo-gold" }, "RAWCRAFT"),
React.createElement("div", { /* divider line */ }),
React.createElement("div", { className: "logo-slogan" }, "Real Stories. Raw Energy. Refined Craft."),
```

**After**: Clean logo with only the essential tagline
```javascript
// New structure - clean and focused
React.createElement("div", { className: "logo-slogan", style: { marginTop: "1rem" } }, 
    "Real Stories. Raw Energy. Refined Craft."
),
```

### 2. Added Shine Animation Effect

**Implementation**: CSS-based shine effect with hover trigger
```css
.logo-shine {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.logo-shine::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: -50%;
    left: -50%;
    width: 200%;
    height: 200%;
    background: linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        transparent,
        rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.3),
        transparent
    );
    transform: translateX(-100%) translateY(-100%) rotate(45deg);
    transition: transform 0.6s ease;
}

.logo-shine:hover::before {
    transform: translateX(100%) translateY(100%) rotate(45deg);
}

.logo-shine:hover {
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.5));
}
```
