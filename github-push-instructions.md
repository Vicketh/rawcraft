# GitHub Push Instructions for Rawcraft Website
## How to Push Your Changes to GitHub Repository

### 🔐 Authentication Setup Required

GitHub no longer accepts password authentication. You need to set up a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Push Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account (Vicketh)
2. **Click your profile picture** (top right) → Settings
3. **Navigate to Developer settings** (left sidebar, bottom)
4. **Click "Personal access tokens"** → "Tokens (classic)"
5. **Click "Generate new token"** → "Generate new token (classic)"
6. **Configure your token:**
   - **Note**: "Rawcraft Website Updates"
   - **Expiration**: Choose 90 days or custom
   - **Scopes**: Check these boxes:
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
     - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages)
7. **Click "Generate token"**
8. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

### 2. Configure Git with Your Credentials

Open terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
cd "/home/vickmbui/Documents/BLACK STUDIOS"

# Configure your Git identity (one-time setup)
git config --global user.name "Vicketh"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"  # Replace with your actual email

# Optional: Store credentials to avoid repeated prompts
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### 3. Push Your Changes

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd "/home/vickmbui/Documents/BLACK STUDIOS"

# Verify all changes are committed
git status

# Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for credentials)
git push origin main
```

**When prompted for credentials:**
- **Username**: `Vicketh`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If push fails with authentication error:
1. **Double-check token**: Make sure you copied the entire token
2. **Check token permissions**: Ensure `repo` scope is enabled
3. **Try token in URL**: Use the direct URL method above
4. **Clear credentials**: `git config --global --unset credential.helper`

### If you see "Everything up-to-date":
Your changes are already pushed! Check GitHub to confirm.

### If you get merge conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts in files
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```
